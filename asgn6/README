/*--------------------------------INSTRUCTIONS--------------------------------*/
1. Compile the c source code by entering "make"

2. mush in a minimally useful shell, you can execute most commands and change
directories using cd

/*---------------------------------LIMITATIONS--------------------------------*/
Mush sets some maximum values for the command line as follows:
    command line length: 512 bytes
    commands in a pipeline: 10
    arguments to a command: 10

These maximum values can be modified in the check_valid_input.h file and
should not affect the behavior of the program.

This program was the most mentally challenging program in my opinion. I had 
dificulties with pipelining but i believe that i have it working. I wasn't too
sure how to handle some issues, such as you have to enter ^D twice to get the
shell to quit in the middle of a command. The other issue that i did not 
account for was getting interupted in the middle of parsing the line. I could
not figure out how to simulate this, because parseline happens too quickly for
me to press ^C in the middle of it. This was happening on its own earlier
today and after I came back from a break, it magically started working... So
then i didn't know how to simulate it again and actually fix it. One other
thing I was unsure about was when to block off signals in the parent and child
proceses. It seems to be working, and I've tried as many tests as I could think
of to get it to fail but was not able to... I'm sure you can haha

Anyway, this class was really difficult and time consuming but was by far my
favorite class this year. You are a fantastic professor, and I really 
appreciate you posting the lectures afterward as thats super helpful when I'm
stuck and didn't quite soak in everything during lecture. 

Happy Holidays, and Ill see you in 453!
