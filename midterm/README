I am not able to save the writeable pdf so this is where I will put my answers.

1. The fundamental difference between system calls and standard io is that 
system calls are significantly more expensive in terms of time and resources.
Systems calls are accessing the system interface directly, whereas standard io
is often accessing the systems calls but are more efficient because they will
typically buffer the IO so that it is not stopping the process to acces the
system interface constantly. Standard IO will often grab more information than
you maybe need in order to prevent having to go back to the interface as often.
The other thing is that standard IO is not instant because it is buffered. The
system calls work as a sort of interrupt where it will stop the process to get
the IO and then resume the process, so it will read or write as soon as you 
want it to, but it takes longer to return to your process. Buffered standard io
waits until it fills the buffer to access the system interface, so your IO may
lag behind what you want. Another detail about system calls is that system
calls run with permissions of the kernel.

2. The umask is the set of permissions not to give. You want to AND the inverse
of the umask with the created permissions for the file and that will give you
the permissions.
The umask is:				101 010 111
The inverted umask is:			101 101 000
File created with these permissions: 	110 110 100
Final Permission: 			100 100 000

So the permission are Read for the User, Read for the Group and none for other.
