I don't think there is much about this program that you need to know. I know
that there could be a possible race condition between when I turn on my timer
and when I am waiting for it so I could miss the first signal, but since the
signals are only coming every half second, the time it takes to get from the 
timer set to the wait is very unlikely to take a half second and miss it.
