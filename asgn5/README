* Assignment 5: parseline 
*
* Erin Rylie Clark (eclark04)
*******************************************************************************/

/*--------------------------------INSTRUCTIONS--------------------------------*/
1. Compile the c source code by entering "make"

2. parseline reads from stdin. One way to do this is to pipe your command line
    into parseline as follows:
        echo '<command here>' | ./parseline

/*---------------------------------LIMITATIONS--------------------------------*/
Parseline sets some maximum values for the command line as follows:
    command line length: 512 bytes
    commands in a pipeline: 10
    arguments to a command: 10

These maximum values can be modified in the check_valid_input.h file and
should not affect the behavior of the program.

/*------------------------------------OTHER-----------------------------------*/
This version of parseline exits on all errors. I believe in the mush assignment
that this will not be acceptable as a shell cannot quit at every mistyped
command. This will be changed in the mush program.
 
In addition, I decided to use dynamic memory allocation for parseline as I 
thought this was the easiest way to deal with various strings and separating
them out. This program is not currently freeing everything it allocates because
of the previous statement about exiting on errors. The mush program will need
to free everything it allocates.
