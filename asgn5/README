This program was very challenging for me. Although I (think) implemented all of
the error checking, and it passes all of your given tests, it is not quite 
robust as I had hoped to get it for how much time I had spent on it. I was 
hoping to have time to implement some extra features, but although I knew this
was going to be a large program, I hadn't expected it to be as large as it was
and it took me longer than I had planned to write it, so I ran out of time
for extra things. Hopefully this passes enough of your tests but I think there
may be some edge cases that I did not account for.
