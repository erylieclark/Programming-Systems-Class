* Assignment 3: hencode and hdecode

/*--------------------------------INSTRUCTIONS--------------------------------*/
1. Compile the c source code by entering "make"

2. Compress a file by entering ./hencode inputfile [outputfile]

3. Decompress a file by entering ./hdecode [(inputfile | '-') [outputfile]]

/*------------------------------------OTHER-----------------------------------*/
With this program, I tried to be really thorough and check return values for all
system calls. I also tried to account for any user input errors that could occur
such as trying to decompress an already uncompressed file or entering in too
many or too few arguments. I tried to keep all of the major steps together in
different source files to keep it organized. I also tried to increase the
performance of the program by buffering the input and output when reading and
writing from the files. This will likely only make a difference on very large
files but I was careful to always check when the buffers were full to prevent
losing any data. I really enjoyed the concept of this program and feel fairly
good about how it turned out! Hopefully your tests do too...
