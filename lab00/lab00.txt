Goals and Expectations:

I am taking this class because I am trying to get into a more firmware engineering career instead of the mechanical engineering I did as my undergrad. Id like to take a class based more on the programming aspects as I didn't get a chance to take anything like that in my undergrad. I am interested in learning more about how to make a program run effectively and efficiently and I am hoping that I get to learn that with this class.

3. It is never acceptable to allow someone else to have your work for reference or to refer to someone else's workwhile writing your own.

Cheating requires an "F" course grade


I agree.
