This program was very challenging for me. Although I (think) implemented all of
the error checking, there were still some cases where I was having issues that
I could not figure out. It is not nearly as robust as I had hoped to get it as
I was having trouble with some of the basics. For one, my check_requested_
paths function in read_tar.c was working just fine until the named paths got
longer. When the current path was the same as the requested path, the strlens
produced a value that was just one off, and although strcmp should have
returned true anyway, it was not and I couldn't figure out why. I had skipped
the creating a new symlink portion as I ran out of time, and although I did
implement the creating the tar with a prefix, I did not get it to work. 
Overall, I'm a bit disappointed I didn't get further with how much I worked on
this and how much I had hoped to get done.
