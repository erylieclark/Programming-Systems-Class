1. Compile the c source code by entering "make"

2. Run the file in any directory that you want to know the path of
    simply by calling the absolute pathname of the program. For example:
	/path/name/mypwd
/*------------------------------------OTHER-----------------------------------*/
There is not much about this program that I can think to tell you. I did a quick
test of the "pathname too long" portion simply by removing the ifndef statement
around PATH_MAX and shortening it to less than what I knew the directory would
be. Other than that, I had a bit of an issue with device numbers but still
managed to get it working as far as I know.
