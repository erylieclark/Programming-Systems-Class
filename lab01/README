Laboratory Exercise 1

Erin Rylie Clark (eclark04)

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Compile the c source file by entering the following:
	gcc lab01.c
2. Run the executable file by entering the following:
	./a.out

ANSWERS:

1. unix3.csc.calpoly.edu
2. I read the introduction to user commands and learned that you could look at a calendar! (I know, very simple but I didn't know that). I also learned about the 'find' command to look for certain files in the system (although not great for large file systems) and a found the commands for navigating directories to be particularly useful (such as 'cd ..' for getting to one directory back).
3. I used vim because a friend had recommended learning it a while ago, so it was easier for me to return to. It is kind of nice to have an editor where my fingers don't need to leave the keyboard.
4. My program is simply supposed to output "Hello, World!" to the user. The only real particular issue I came across was running the executable file by typing 'a.out' instead of './a.out' which I learned tells the shell to look in the current directory for the file instead of looking in the folders found in PATH. I was also unsure what kind of instructions are applicable to this type of program.
